# Elements-of-Data-Visualization
Final project for the data visualization course.

"What is the course about?
This course is an introduction to key design principles and techniques for interactively visualizing data. The major goals of this course are to understand how visual representations can help in the analysis and understanding of complex data, how to design effective visualizations, and how to create your own interactive visualizations using modern web-based frameworks. 

Course objectives/student goals
In this course we will study techniques and algorithms for creating effective visualizations based on principles from graphic design, visual art, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science. The course is targeted both towards students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students interested in building better visualization tools and systems.

You should expect to:
  Evaluate and critique visualization designs
  Design and implement interactive data visualizations
  Gain an overview of techniques and grammar
  Develop a substantial visualization project

Final Project
At the core of the course is your project. The goal of the project is to design an interactive visualization that answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, implement them, and critically evaluate the results. The path to a good visualization is going to involve mistakes and wrong turns. It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes are valuable in finding the path to a solution, to broadly explore the design space, and to iterate designs to improve possible solutions. The project has an intermediate milestone that will allow you to get feedback and to iterate."
